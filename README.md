# RisQuus-V

A RiscV OS

## Goals of this OS:

- Manage Directory
- ~~Execute/compile C/C++ (and possibly Rust)~~ replacing this with a more reasonable linux like cat command to print out text
- Have a text editor
- ~~Allow SSH/ports~~ (Too advanced for me atm, will attempt when I have a better understanding of OSs)

### RisQuus V:

A RiscV OS for learning purposes, maybe a bit too ambitous for my skills, but I will learn.
